TabPFN is a foundation model for tabular data that outperforms traditional methods while 
being dramatically faster. This repository contains the core PyTorch implementation with
CUDA optimization.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Major Update: Version 2.0**

Complete codebase overhaul with new architecture and features. Previous version available at [v1.0.0](../../tree/v1.0.0).

## üåê TabPFN Ecosystem

Choose the right TabPFN implementation for your needs:

- **[TabPFN Client](https://github.com/automl/tabpfn-client)**: Easy-to-use API client for cloud-based inference
- **[TabPFN Extensions](https://github.com/priorlabs/tabpfn-extensions)**: Community extensions and integrations
- **TabPFN (this repo)**: Core implementation for local deployment and research

## üèÅ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Simple installation
pip install tabpfn

# Development installation
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pre-commit install
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, roc_auc_score
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

from tabpfn import TabPFNClassifier

# Load data
X, y = load_breast_cancer(return_X_y=True)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.33, random_state=42)

# Initialize a classifier
clf = TabPFNClassifier()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict probabilities
prediction_probabilities = clf.predict_proba(X_test)
print("ROC AUC:", roc_auc_score(y_test, prediction_probabilities[:, 1]))

# Predict labels
predictions = clf.predict(X_test)
print("Accuracy", accuracy_score(y_test, predictions))
```

## üí° Usage Tips

TabPFN is designed to work out-of-the-box with minimal preprocessing:

- **No preprocessing needed**: TabPFN handles normalization internally
- **Categorical variables**: Use numerical encodings (floats for ordered, OrdinalEncoder for unordered)
- **Automatic ensembling**: Controls with `N_ensemble_configurations`
- **Independent predictions**: Test samples can be predicted individually or in batch
- **Differentiable**: Core model is differentiable (except preprocessing)
- **GPU Support**: Use `device='cuda'` for GPU acceleration
