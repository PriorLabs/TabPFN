class TimeUsageTracker:

    Supports starting, stopping, and resetting segments. It will
    warn if any segment runs longer than the threshold defined by
    `TIME_WARNING_CPU` (default: 10 minutes). Note that resetting an
    active segment issues a warning.

    Attributes:
        active_segments (dict[str, float]):
            Maps segment labels to their start times.

        completed_segments (list[tuple[str, float]]):

        _timers (dict[str, threading.Timer]):
            Timers that trigger warnings when a segment exceeds the threshold.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If attempting to start a segment that's
                      already active or stop one that isn't active.
