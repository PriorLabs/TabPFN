<<<<<<< HEAD
Refactored preprocessing pipeline:
* Introduced `FeatureSchema` system to track column metadata through transformations, replacing raw categorical index lists.
* Added `PreprocessingPipeline` and `PreprocessingStep` interfaces for modular transformations and updated all preprocessing steps.
* Added `TabPFNLabelEncoder` for centralized label validation and metadata extraction.
=======
Public method `ensure_compatible_fit_inputs()` now returns the target name if present.
